    
-- Please be aware this experiment was created for my personal training purposes. --
    

On this experiment:
 - I have created a basic html file, with instructions to play the game;
 - I have created a basic program in JavaScript, that allows to:
    - Input a User's choice of either rock, paper or scissors by a prompt action;
    - Randomly generate the computer's choice;
    - JavaScript architected based on Recursive methods; 

If you want to try it for yourself:
 - Download the repository to your device;
 - Once you have the files, open the index.html file;
 - Follow the instructions on the index.html webpage;
